# Data Science for Linguists FS2025 Class Living Document

Welcome to our class's living document! This is a collaborative guide for using Quarto, Markdown, R, and GitHub for data science projects. This document has a dual purpose. The first one is for you to practice working with GitHub on a large useful collaborative task. The second one is to create a collaborative document and set of best practices for your group projects.

## Overview

Each of you will be contributing to the living document by choosing a topic and editing one or more document sections. You can find a list of topics in the [Task List](https://github.com/UZH-Lisguistics-Data-Science-Class-2025/living_document/issues/1). Feel free to suggest additional topics if you think that something is missing. Everyone is required to complete 3-4 tasks. This is a mandatory activity and is required for successful class completion.

We will be using a branch-based workflow. You can find an introduction and detailed instructions in the file [`git_branch_workflows.pdf`](git_branch_workflows.pdf). You will complete your contributions using isolated revisions (branches) and ask me for approval before bringing your changes to the final document. This will help us ensure high quality of the final product.

## Instructions

1. Familiarize yourself with branch workflows as described in [`git_branch_workflows.pdf`](git_branch_workflows.pdf)
2. Pick a task from the [Task List](https://github.com/UZH-Lisguistics-Data-Science-Class-2025/living_document/issues/1)
3. Comment on the [Task List](https://github.com/UZH-Lisguistics-Data-Science-Class-2025/living_document/issues/1) discussion with at least two tasks you would like to complete
